q032:
We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits 1
to n exactly once; for example, the 5-digit number, 15234, is 1 through 5 pandigital.

The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39 Ã— 186 = 7254, containing multiplicand,
multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 pandigital.

Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity can be written
as a 1 through 9 pandigital.

HINT: Some products can be obtained in more than one way so be sure to only include it
once in your sum.

Algorithm:
1. Given a * b = c, where a, b, c must contain all digits 1-9
2. Hence, a = 9 permutate i, and b = (9-i) permutate j
3. Since i + j < 9 digits - i - j + 1 --> i + j < 5, (i, j) = (1, 4), (2, 3), ...
