function [ y ] = combiSum( x, set )
% COMBISUM Calculate all combination of sum of entries from SET to achieve X.
%   X   = An integer that may be obtained from sum of entries from SET. For
%         each combination sum:
%         1. Not all entries in SET need to be used.
%         2. One or more entries in SET can be repeated.
%   SET = Contains a set of unique integers to be summed to get X.
%
% For example, X = 10, SET = [1, 2]
%   Y = {[1, 1, ..., 1]; [1, 1, 2, 2, ..., 2], ...}
